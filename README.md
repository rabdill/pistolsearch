# PistolSearch.com

## About the project
Pistol Search serves two purposes: One, it seemed like a pretty big gap in the otherwise bounteous amount of firearm information on the internet. Two, I need to get better at JavaScript and prove to people that I actually do have an idea of what I'm doing. Employers have a tough time validating the skill level of prospective tech workers, so I thought, "Hey, I can help with this. I'll put a ton of effort into an app for the most divisive hobby in America. Let's hope for the best."

### Technologies used
JavaScript, obviously. In particular, the [AngularJS framework](https://angularjs.org/) runs the frontend, with styling and responsive design taken care of with the [Bootstrap 3 library](http://getbootstrap.com/). I also use the [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) library, at least until I feel better about using the quirkier, JS-native helpers.

Right now, [Protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/) is the only testing tool in use, using the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/2.4/introduction.html) test framework.
