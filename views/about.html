		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Hi! My name is Rich. My hope is for this little app to fix two issues I've run into: First, I need a lot of practice writing JavaScript. Second, it's amazing to me just how disparate the information is for those wanting to get into shooting &ndash; not only is it really hard <strong>finding pistols that met specific requirements</strong>, but often, at least to beginners, it's hard to <strong>make an intelligent list of requirements in the first place</strong>. What are the downsides of a steel frame? Should I care about the differences between .40 S&amp;W and 10mm? Why do some guns swap out a safety for a decocker?

		<p>Forums like Reddit's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/guns">/r/guns</a> are a huge help, but I thought I might be able to put in a little bit of internet elbow grease to make things easier for people who might know what they're looking for, but not where to look.

		<p><strong>I'm not selling anything here</strong>, and you won't find too much advice from me, at least not without ample citations from those who know far better than I. If any political content creeps into the site, you should know that it's because I've been kidnapped and replaced with a synth who looks exactly like me but mistakenly believes people care what he thinks.

		<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
		<p>I have a distinct suspicion that this text won't actually help me at all if something comes up, but I'd like to take a minute to remind all you nice people that this site is intended to be a jumping-off point for your own research, and is <strong>purely informational</strong> in nature. I'd like to think the data is accurate, but most of this site was built quite late at night and there are bound to be some embarrassing typos in here somewhere. Please do not blame them for whatever horrible stupid thing happened after you bought a gun.

		<p>Guns are dangerous &ndash; like, <em>so</em> dangerous. If they weren't, nobody would want one. Be careful. <a href="http://www.nrainstructors.org/Search.aspx">Take a safety class</a>. Hell, take two, before you even buy a weapon. But whatever you do, <strong>don't sue me</strong>.

		<h3>Site media</h3>
		<p>Regarding the mixed media on the site: Without exception, the firearm photos on this site were taken directly from manufacturer websites. If you are a gun manufacturer and for some reason have a problem with this, please get in touch &ndash; there is a <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kdI9Ws13iuMotAL5WeJyaKFrIhT4e3i5Zafyhh5FeI4/viewform">contact form</a></strong> linked from all over the site.

		<p>My inclusion of YouTube videos on the pistol detail pages should not be taken as an endorsement of whatever silliness might show up in the videos. I obviously can't watch every single one from start to finish &ndash; I've done my best to stick to ones that looked helpful or were from YouTube content creators that I trust. If you spot someone in a video swinging a loaded gun around a shopping mall or doing something bizarre to "clean" something, please don't think it's because I think whatever they're doing is a good idea. If it bothers you <em>that</em> much, let me know and I'll take a closer look.

		<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
		<p>I use Google Analytics to keep track of traffic coming to pistolsearch.com. That means Google is using cookies &ndash; small files stored by your web browser &ndash; to help me better understand how people are using the website: It helps figure out where users are coming from, and what they are looking for when they arrive. Google has published <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">an explanation of this process</a> to which they request I provide a link.
		<p>I hope to one day transition over to a self-hosted analytics solution, but Pistol Search's current configuration (static hosting on Amazon S3, if you're interested) doesn't allow that to happen quite yet. If it makes you feel better, I've specifically disabled the enhanced "cohort analysis" features of the product that may track demographic information and user interests. I don't need to spy on anybody, I just want to know what people want from the site.

		<h3>Getting help</h3>
		<p>I think it's important to point out that the majority of U.S. gun deaths are suicides &ndash; <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/05/24/suicides-account-for-most-gun-deaths/">61 percent of them in 2010</a>, more than 19,000 Americans. If you need a hand, there are organizations all over the country that can help <a href="http://www.nami.org/Find-Support">connect you to the professionals you need</a>. Depression is <a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/depression-what-you-need-to-know-12-2015/index.shtml">a real, diagnosable illness</a>, and we're getting better at treating it every year.
		<p>But even if you don't have any problems with mental illness, people you care about might. Of teens who kill themselves with a gun, <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/09/suicide-gun-stats">82 percent are using one that belongs to a family member</a>. In addition, suicide attempts involving a firearm are far more likely to succeed: Though 13 percent of all suicide attempts are lethal, <strong><a href="http://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(04)00069-1/abstract">91 percent</a> of attempted suicides with a gun result in death</strong>. Please, be mindful.
